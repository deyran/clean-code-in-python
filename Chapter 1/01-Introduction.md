# Chapter 1 Introduction, Code Formatting, and Tools

The main go of this chapter is to show what Clean Code is and the need to produce quality code. Without quality code, the project will face perils of failing due to the accumulation of technical debit.

To produce quality code, the concepts of formatting and documenting the code as a continuous task play a fundamental role in keeping code base maintainable and workable.
  
Given the importance of the continuous task of keeping the code aligned to a reference, in this chapter will show the use of automated tools to make our work easier.

# Introduction

In the first two sections we will understand what Clean Code is and its importance for the success of a software engineering project.

There are rules that allow to maintaining  good code quality, but there are also exceptions. The rules cannot be applied everywhere, identify these types of situations will be discussed.

## The meaning of Clean Code

In this book you won't find a sole or a strict definition of Clean Code. But when we, as developers, write code, it's not just for the machine to read and execute our programs, we write code for other developers to read as well.

As a developers, we spend more time reading code than writing it. That's why Clean Code shows how to produce quality code, to communicate ours ideas to other developers. 

By the end of this book, you will come up with own definition of Clean Code.
